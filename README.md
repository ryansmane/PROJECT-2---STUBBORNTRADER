## Review
- Much better. This is a financial React App that uses Hooks, Route, Switch, and calls to a third-party stock tracker API.
- The user may enter a dollar amount to invest every week, day, or month in a stock symbol of their choice starting on a date of their choice (if the date entered is before IPO, the app will correct them).
- It has a tacky mobile view that is really only decent on an Iphone 7/8 and a more elegant styling on desktop up to a certain point when the tables start to fall into themselves. I decided to do polar styles to try to learn CSS, as I had been avoiding it up to this point. 
- And it turns out I was right to be avoiding it, because after 200+ lines of arduous styling, I had gained a massive amount of admiration for vanilla CSS artists and very little to show for it inside of my app. From now on it will be bootstrap for me.
